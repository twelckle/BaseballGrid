## Overview

**Diamond Connections** is a React-based game inspired by the popular baseball puzzle concept known as the Immaculate Grid. The game challenges users to fill out a 3x3 grid where each cell corresponds to a baseball player who has played for the teams indicated by the intersecting row and column headers.

## Features

- **3x3 Grid System**: The grid features rows and columns labeled with different MLB teams. The objective is to name a player who has played for both teams at each intersection.
- **Team and Player Verification**: The game utilizes data from the Major League Baseball (MLB) API to verify the accuracy of each player's team affiliations.
- **Score Tracking**: Users can see how many correct guesses they've made, with the game keeping track of their progress as they attempt to complete the grid.
- **Unlimited Play**: Unlike some daily puzzles, BaseballGrid can be played multiple times, offering endless combinations of team matchups.
- **Historical Insights**: The game helps users learn more about baseball history by challenging them to think of players who had significant careers across different teams.
- **Inspired by Immaculate Grid**: BaseballGrid was developed as a personal project before the Immaculate Grid became a well-known game. It provides a similar but independent experience for baseball enthusiasts.
